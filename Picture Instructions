These are instructions on how to draw a pixel onto the LED matrix.
This assumes you already have it wired and powered. If you need help with that, go here:

You will also need to have a little familiarity with a command-line interface.
Instructions are written for mac, but windows shouldn't be too different.


First, you need to select a picture to convert. I recommend something smaller than your matrix, as it will only display the top-left part if the picture is too big.
Next, you need to download the program. Keep in mind where you put the folder.
Next, you need to go into the terminal. When entering the commands, remove the $ before them.

First Command:
$ cd FILE_PATH
Where FILE_PATH is the file path to convertPictureToCode.py
It should look something like /Users/MYNAME/Downloads/...

Second Command:
$ ls
You should see convertPictureToCode.py in the list.

Third Command:
$ python convertPictureToCode.py FILE_PATH VAR_NAME
Where FILE_PATH is the file path to the picture you wish to convert
and VAR_NAME is what you want the variable to be named.

Then, just copy and paste the code that's printed out into the arduino and fill in a couple of blanks with the variable name, and you're good!
